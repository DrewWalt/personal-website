## My Personal Website
## drewjwalton.com

This is a website that i created in order to test my skills with javascript as well as learn how to work with react.

To view this project in browser the link above will work unless I have updated my personal page.  If that does not work and you would still like to view my page you can download the files and use "yarn start" to run it on your machine.
